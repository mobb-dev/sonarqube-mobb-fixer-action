# Mobb Fixer for Checkmarx One GitHub Integration

This action is used alongside the Sonarcloud's native Webhook integration with GitHub where SonarCloud publishes a scan report in the Pull Request's comment section. 

This action will monitor the presence of such a comment and trigger a job to download the SAST report. The SAST report is submitted to the Mobb vulnerability analysis engine, and a fix is presented to the Pull Request's comment section. 

If you are using this on a private repo, the Mobb user to which the API key belongs must have access to the repo and must approve GitHub access for the user on the Mobb platform beforehand.
